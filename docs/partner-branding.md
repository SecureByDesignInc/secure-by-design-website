# Partner branding

The user confirmed membership in the Red Hat and Tenable partner programs on September 11, 2026. The shared site header places both logos beside the company branding, above navigation, and uses general partner labels without claiming a tier, certification, or sponsorship. The same header appears on the Community pages. On narrow screens, partner branding wraps below the company logo.

## Official assets

Partner labels, topics, and assets are shared through `content/partners.json`, with Tenable before Red Hat. Both actions read “Request available resources.” They are enabled `type="button"` controls styled as links, without a destination or event handler. Click, touch, Enter, and Space activate the controls without navigation, URL changes, form submission, or requests. “Coming soon” is removed. Keep this behavior until the user explicitly requests a destination or resource-request flow. Run the normal content preparation/build to refresh the Community headers as well. No visitor-facing editor or credentials are needed.

- `public/partners/red-hat.svg`: unmodified Red Hat reverse corporate logo, downloaded from https://static.redhat.com/libs/redhat/brand-assets/2/corp/logo--on-dark.svg. The source asset is linked by Red Hat's website.
- `public/partners/tenable.svg`: unmodified `Tenable logo/Lockup - Small Use/RGB/SVG/Tenable Lockup Small Use White RGB.svg`, extracted from the official logo kit linked at https://www.tenable.com/media: https://dam.tenable.com/778375b6-4f07-4062-b0fd-b44900e96d9e/web-asset-tenable-logo-bw-zip.zip.

The original dark-background assets above are retained for reference. The compact header now uses the official light-background variants below on the same light surface as the company branding, with 40px logo containers and navy text. All logo artwork keeps its original colors and proportions. The partner labels are separate page text, not alterations to the logos. Do not apply filters, opacity, gradients, or shadows to these assets.

Red Hat's current guidance uses corporate co-branding rather than legacy program badges:

## Current light-background assets

- `public/partners/red-hat-light.svg`: the official SVG embedded in Red Hat’s public navigation component at https://www.redhat.com/modules/contrib/red_hat_shared_libs/dist/rhds-elements/4.2.1/rh-navigation-primary/rh-navigation-primary.js. Exported with an XML namespace so it can be loaded as a standalone image; paths and color definitions are unchanged.
- `public/partners/tenable-light.svg`: unmodified `Tenable logo/Lockup - Small Use/RGB/SVG/Tenable Lockup Small Use Black RGB.svg` from the same official logo archive listed above.

The header omits the topic descriptions to match the compact company branding. The descriptions remain available in the shared partner data.
